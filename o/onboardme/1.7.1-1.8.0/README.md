 ## Features
 
 <details>
   <summary><h4>Keep your Dot Files Up To Date Across multiple systems</h4></summary>
-  
+
 `onboardme` can manage your [dot files] using a git by turning your home directory into a repo.
 We even provide default dot files, so you don't have to manage them
 - The [default dot files] are open source, and the maintainers use these themselves
 - They cover a lot of common apps/tools you probably want anyway
 - They have consistent colorschemes accross different CLI/TUI programs ðŸ˜ƒ
 - They set all the helpful BASH aliases you could need (zsh support coming soon)
 
 </details>
 
 <details>
   <summary><h4>Package management accross multiple package managers<h4></summary>
-    
+
 We install and upgrade libraries and apps using common package managers. We also provide a currated list of default packages.
-  
+
 - checkout the [default packages]
 - supports `brew`, `apt`, `snap`, `flatpak`, and `pip` (and you can add your own ðŸ˜„)
 - group together packages for different kinds of environments
   - onboardme provides default package groups:
     - default (no desktop GUI apps installed by default, always installed)
     - macOS (default apps for _macOS only_ apps, always installed on macOS)
     - gui (default GUI apps for Linux desktops, optionally installed)
     - devops (devops related tooling, optionally installed)
- 
+
 <sub>**Linux ARM Users NOTE**: `brew` is currently [unsupported on linux/arm64](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#arm-unsupported), and as we'd have to compile everything from source anyway, we don't support running the brew package manager via onboardme on linux/arm64 or (AArch64) at all right now._
 We do have a docker image ([jessebot/onboardme:latest-arm](https://hub.docker.com/r/jessebot/onboardme)) optimized for arm though that you can run on AArch64 and it's perfect for a dockerized dev environment on an M1 or later mac or any other ARM 64 device that runs docker :)</sub>

   <summary><h4>NeoVim Plugin Installtion and Updates<h4></summary>
 
 
 `onboardme` keeps your neovim plugins installed and up to date with [lazy.nvim] under the hood.
-  
+
 <h4>Why no vim though?</h4>
-  
-If you haven't already made the switch from Vim to [NeoVim], you can try out NeoVim today with `onboardme` :D We used to support both neovim _and_ vim, but these days none of the primary developers of this repo use pure vim anymore, so we can't ensure it's up to standards. All of your knowledge from vim is still helpful in neovim though, and we highly recommend switching as neovim has a lot more features and a very active plugin community :) NeoVim maintains a guide on how to switch from vim [here](https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim.html#nvim-from-vim).

 ## Features
 
 <details>
   <summary><h4>Keep your Dot Files Up To Date Across multiple systems</h4></summary>
-  
+
 `onboardme` can manage your [dot files] using a git by turning your home directory into a repo.
 We even provide default dot files, so you don't have to manage them
 - The [default dot files] are open source, and the maintainers use these themselves
 - They cover a lot of common apps/tools you probably want anyway
 - They have consistent colorschemes accross different CLI/TUI programs ðŸ˜ƒ
 - They set all the helpful BASH aliases you could need (zsh support coming soon)
 
 </details>
 
 <details>
   <summary><h4>Package management accross multiple package managers<h4></summary>
-    
+
 We install and upgrade libraries and apps using common package managers. We also provide a currated list of default packages.
-  
+
 - checkout the [default packages]
 - supports `brew`, `apt`, `snap`, `flatpak`, and `pip` (and you can add your own ðŸ˜„)
 - group together packages for different kinds of environments
   - onboardme provides default package groups:
     - default (no desktop GUI apps installed by default, always installed)
     - macOS (default apps for _macOS only_ apps, always installed on macOS)
     - gui (default GUI apps for Linux desktops, optionally installed)
     - devops (devops related tooling, optionally installed)
- 
+
 <sub>**Linux ARM Users NOTE**: `brew` is currently [unsupported on linux/arm64](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#arm-unsupported), and as we'd have to compile everything from source anyway, we don't support running the brew package manager via onboardme on linux/arm64 or (AArch64) at all right now._
 We do have a docker image ([jessebot/onboardme:latest-arm](https://hub.docker.com/r/jessebot/onboardme)) optimized for arm though that you can run on AArch64 and it's perfect for a dockerized dev environment on an M1 or later mac or any other ARM 64 device that runs docker :)</sub>

   <summary><h4>NeoVim Plugin Installtion and Updates<h4></summary>
 
 
 `onboardme` keeps your neovim plugins installed and up to date with [lazy.nvim] under the hood.

 <h4>Why no vim though?</h4>
-  
-If you haven't already made the switch from Vim to [NeoVim], you can try out NeoVim today with `onboardme` :D We used to support both neovim _and_ vim, but these days none of the primary developers of this repo use pure vim anymore, so we can't ensure it's up to standards. All of your knowledge from vim is still helpful in neovim though, and we highly recommend switching as neovim has a lot more features and a very active plugin community :) NeoVim maintains a guide on how to switch from vim [here](https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim.html#nvim-from-vim).
